Questions:

Should app be an object or namespace?
If it is an object, then who owns it? for true RAII, the user should own it.

What about hiding data/functionality from the user, but have it still available internally?
I might create a Pimpl object that others can inherit from. It would use std::aligned_storage with a static check for the size
in the constructor. However, this would be a bit of maintenance.




Perhaps I should make nothing subclass from the kit objects, because I keep running into design difficulties.

The only one currently that requires subclassing is the WidgetContainer. It is fine if a client subclasses widget, since it is pure virtual.

---Can I have the user subclass Widget, and have WidgetContainer as a component?
