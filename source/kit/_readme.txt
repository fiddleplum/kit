Notes to future self:

I am the only one who will ever use this library, even though you may think otherwise.
This library is solely so I can create other greater things. In that light, everything
should be in one single folder, with no include folder or fancy virtual inheritance.

There should be no "internal" functions, since I am both the developer and user,
nothing is internal to me. Class forwarding and pimpl should only be used to reduce
compilation time or so that an external program's source code won't
depend on the SDL.h or other such headers.

Remember, keep it simple.
